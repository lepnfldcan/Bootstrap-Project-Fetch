**Fetch**

This project, created as part of Dr. Angela Lu's course with the App Brewery, involves constructing a webpage by reverse-engineering a visual example. All starting code is credited to the App Brewery.

**Description**

In this project, I accessed the Bootstrap website to find the appropriate elements needed to replicate a design I had as a visual reference. The task was to recreate this page, focusing on the layout and aesthetics.
